# ChronoFS

## Overview
**ChronoFS** is a lightweight, C++17-based file management and version control system **built from scratch** — no external VCS like Git.  

It allows you to:
- Create, delete, rename, and move files or directories (folders/sub-folders)
- Maintain **version history** for every file with the ability to rollback or restore
- Perform **diff** operations between file versions
- Log and track all file changes
- Query **status** of the working directory
- Use a **command-line interface** for all operations

Designed for scalability and modularity, **ChronoFS** uses an **object-oriented architecture** that makes it easy to extend with new commands and storage backends.

---

## Architecture
ChronoFS follows a **layered modular architecture**:

### **Modules**
- **CLI Module (`cli/`)** → Parses commands (`status`, `log`, `diff`, etc.) and executes corresponding service calls.
- **File System Module (`fs/`)** → Abstracts file/directory manipulation, path handling, and file metadata.
- **Version Control Module (`vcs/`)** → Manages snapshot creation, storage, and retrieval of file versions.
- **Utilities Module (`util/`)** → Logging, color output, config parsing, error handling.

---

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ Create, delete, move, and rename files/folders
- ✅ Track file history with version timestamps
- ✅ Restore any previous file version
- ✅ Show file changes using a `diff` command
- ✅ Query working directory status
- ✅ Logging with detailed change history
- ✅ Modular architecture for easy future expansion

## 🌟 Acknowledgments
Built with ❤️ in C++17 to show how **version control concepts** can be implemented **from scratch** without Git.
